Try to keep php at top as much as possible
Use '' for php and "" for html as much as possible
php likes 4 spaces, no tabs
for curly braces, open on same line except for classes which open on new line
Java-like classes do exist (use -> instead of .)
require dumps file like copying in text
could use require to add common header code to all pages
namespaces - UTexas\CS { code }
PEAR - PHP Extension and Application Repository
Real world uses frameworks (e.g. zend framework 2)
